              <p class="lead">The Poker Companion App is a project I created with the intention of collecting data about your
                online poker opponents and analyzing that data to provide you with insights about your opponents' tendencies,
                what their actions might mean, and how they might react to your actions. The goal is to process the data
                collected to give the user a better idea of when a bluff might be effective and if their opponents might be
                bluffing.</p>
              <p class="lead">This site contains documentation for the project including how to use the app and some additional
                information about how it works. The source code for this project is available in the
                <a href="{{ site.github-project-address }}">project's GitHub repository</a>. A YouTube video demonstrating the
                use of the app is available <a href="{{ site.youtube-demo-address }}">here</a>.</p>
