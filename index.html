              <p class="lead">The Poker Companion App is a project I created with the intention of tracking and collecting data
                about players you play online poker with and analyzing that data to provide insights about your opponents tendancies
                and what their actions might mean. The goal is to process the data collected to give the user a better idea of if
                their opponents are bluffing or if they might fold to a bluff.</p>
              <p class="lead">This site contains documentation for the project including how to use the app and some additional
                information about how it works. A youtube video demonstrating the use of the app is available here:
